                        Hi there and welcome to my website! I'm actively learning how to write HTML and CSS so you're likely to see alot of updates
                        to this site as my knowledge grows.
                        <br>
                        <br> My Name is Steven Zamborsky. I'm a Computer Science graduate from
                        <a href="https://www.sru.edu/">Slippery Rock University</a> of Pennsylvania. Since graduation I've worked at
                        <a href="https://www.creehan.com/">Creehan & Company</a>, a consulting company that was recently acquired by
                        <a href="http://www.inovalon.com/">Inovalon</a>.
                        <br>
                        <br> My job title is "Build and Release Engineer". I primarly create CI/CD pipelines to get code from
                        developer machines to production in an automated fashion. As of recently, I am starting to explore
                        the world of DevOps principles and technology.
