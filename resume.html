                <i>May 2015 - Present</i>
                <br>
                <p>
                    As a Build and Release engineer at Creehan, I've been responsible for learning all software product build, installation and
                    release processes. In addition to these responsibilities, I've worked to automate many nuances of these
                    processes. Finally, I've worked to pioneer and implement various DevOps principles at Creehan.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I've carried out my work with CI/CD pipelines primarily using Team Foundation Server (TFS) and Visual Studio Team Services
                    (VSTS) Build and Release Services. I've written my automation solutions primarily in PowerShell. The
                    CI/CD pipelines I've created integrated with both Git and TFVC version control systems.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I've built CI/CD pipelines to deploy code to private on-premise servers, cloud virtual machines (such as AWS EC2 instances)
                    and Cloud Foundry containers (Pivotal Cloud Foundry to be specific).

                <h3>Slippery Rock University of Pennsylvania - Bachelor of Science in Computer Science</h3>
                <h4>Minor in Information Technology</h4>
                <i>Fall 2012 - Fall 2015</i>
                <p>
                    After highschool graduation I attended Slippery Rock University of Pennsylvania to pursue a Bachelor's in Computer Science.
                    While there, I also picked up a minor in Information Technology where I learned much of my command line
                    interface and scripting skills. I graduated in Fall semester 2015. I was one semester ahead of schedule
                    because of my aggressive course loads.
