        <h3>Creehan & Company - Build and Release Engineer</h3>
        <i>May 2015 - Present</i>
        <br>
        <p>
            As a Build and Release engineer at Creehan, I've been responsible for learning all software product build, installation and release processes.  In addition to these responsibilities, I've worked to automate many nuances of these processes.  Finally, I've worked to pioneer and implement various DevOps principles at Creehan. 
        </p>
        <p>
            I've carried out my work with CI/CD pipelines primarily using Team Foundation Server (TFS) and Visual Studio Team Services (VSTS) Build and Release Services.  I've written my automation solutions primarily in PowerShell.  The CI/CD pipelines I've created integrated with both Git and TFVC version control systems.
        </p>
        <p>
            I've built CI/CD pipelines to deploy code to private on-premise servers, cloud virtual machines (such as AWS EC2 instances) and Cloud Foundry containers (Pivotal Cloud Foundry to be specific).
