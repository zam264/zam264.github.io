                    <h3>General</h3>
                    My name is <b>Steven Raymond Zamborsky</b>.
                    I'm a 20'ish year old guy with a lot of different hobbies, interests and curiosities.
                    I live in <b>Western Pennsylvania</b>, roughly 30 minutes from downtown Pittsburgh.
                    I have had a passion for programming and development since my first computer science class in high
                    school.
                    I graduated
                    <a href="https://www.sru.edu/">Slippery Rock University</a>
                    of Pennsylvania in <b>December of 2015</b> with a <b>Computer Science</b> degree and Information
                    Technology minor.
                    In college I practiced basic programming principles using Java and C++.
                    I elected to take courses teaching the basics of web development using JavaScript.
                    Additionally, I took classes for scripting in both Bash and Windows Command Prompt.
                    Finally, classes such as Assembly and Discrete computing helped contribute to my appreciation and
                    understanding of the field.
                    <br>
                    <h3>Work</h3>
                    From <b>May of 2015</b> through <b>February of 2018</b> I worked at a company called
                    <a href="https://www.creehan.com/">Creehan & Company</a>
                    as a <b>Build and Release Engineer</b>.
                    Creehan creates workflow software for the specialty pharmacy industry.
                    Working at Creehan I've learned a wealth of information and also developed my passion for
                    automation.
                    I helped develop a
                    <a href="https://www.visualstudio.com/learn/what-is-continuous-integration/">Continuous
                        Integration</a>
                    and
                    <a href="https://www.visualstudio.com/learn/what-is-continuous-delivery/">Continuous Delivery</a>
                    infrastructure.
                    The CI/CD infrastructure helped make the software development lifecycle more dependable and
                    consistent.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    In <b>February of 2018</b> I resigned from my position at Creehan & Company to pursue a <b>Build
                        and Deployment Engineer</b> position at
                    <a href="https://www.duquesne.com/">Duquesne Fund Services</a>.
                    I am a DevOps resource for them, primarily working with CI/CD pipelines and general automation of
                    the SDLC.
                    DFS provides technology solutions for hedge funds, asset managers and family offices.
                    <br>
                    <h3>Personal</h3>
                    I try to lead a generally healthy lifestyle, regularly working out, eating healthy (most of the
                    time) and learning when I can.
                    I truly enjoy running and working out and do so nearly every single day.
                    I try to go skiing and hiking every chance I can get.
                    I am a nerd at heart and enjoy all technology new and old.
                    I have quite a few personal projects at any given time, below are a few.
                    <ul>
                        <li>I bought an old PC from 1999 I bought and refurbished to re-live the joys of installing
                            Windows 95</li>
                        <li>I built a 250mm "racing" drone to fly around local fields</li>
                        <li>I recently purchased a GameBoy Advance SP to start re-collecting all the games from the
                            early 2000's that made me feel the most nostalgic</li>
                        <li>I've been experimenting with hosting and securing a web-server with both a repurposed PC
                            and a Raspberry Pi</li>
                    </ul>
                    Finally, I love breaking out of my comfort zone and learning new development platforms whenever I
                    can.
                    Learning how to use platforms such as Amazon Web Services or taking online courses such as Python
                    on SoloLearn are a few examples of this.
