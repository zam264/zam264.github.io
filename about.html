                    My name is Steven Raymond Zamborsky. I'm a 20'ish year old guy with a lot of different hobbies, interests and curiosities.
                    <br>
                    <br> I live in Western Pennsylvania, roughly 30 minutes from downtown Pittsburgh. I have had a passion for
                    programming and development since my first CS class in highschool. I graduated Slippery Rock University
                    of Pennsylvania in 2015 with a Computer Science degree. In college I practiced basic programming principles
                    using Java and C++. I had some classes to make me "well-rounded" like Assembly and Discrete computing.
                    <br>
                    <br> I currently work at a company called Creehan & Company. Creehan creates workflow software for the specialty
                    pharmacy. Working at Creehan I've learned a wealth of information and also developed my obsession with
                    the automated, scalable and consistent of software development and deployment techniques. I'm actively
                    learning about the importance and significance of DevOps and strive to apply the principles and technologies
                    every single day. I believe in iterative, perpetual improvement and will practice it for as long as I
                    work in the software industry.
                    <br>
                    <br> I enjoy running and working out, skiing and hiking. I'm also a nerd at heart. I enjoy retro technology
                    as well as video games new and old. Finally, I really enjoy teaching myself all about the world of software
                    development, from basic things such as expanding my knowledge of languages and web programming to more
                    advanced practices like DevOps principles such as CI/CD and TDD.
                    <br>
                    <br> This page will highlight a few of my interests, talents and act as a platform for me to explore new
                    things.
                    <br>
                    <br> Note that this page will be a living, breathing platform for my learning and exploration so please forgive
                    things like typos and broken content.
