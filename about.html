        <h1>Steven Zamborsky</h1>
        <p>
            My name is Steven Raymond Zamborsky.  I'm a 20'ish year old guy with a lot of different hobbies, interests and curiosities.  
            <br><br>
            I live in Western Pennsylvania, roughly 30 minutes from downtown Pittsburgh.  I have had a passion for programming and development since my first CS class in highschool.  I graduated Slippery Rock University of Pennsylvania in 2011 with a Computer Science degree.  In college I practiced basic programming principles using Java and C++.  I had some classes to make me "well-rounded" like Assembly and Discrete computing.
            <br><br>
            I currently work at a company called Creehan & Company.  Creehan creates workflow software for the specialty pharmacy.  Working at Creehan I've learned a wealth of information and also developed my obsession with the automation, scalability and consistancy of software development and deployment.  I'm actively learning about the importance and significance of DevOps and strive to apply the principles and technologies every single day.  I believe in iterative, perpetual improvement and will practice it for as long as I work in the software industry.
            <br><br>
            I enjoy running and working out, skiing and hiking.  I'm also a nerd at heart.  I enjoy retro technology as well as video games new and old.  Finally, I really enjoy teaching myself all about the world of software development, from basic things such as expanding my knowledge of langauges and web programming to more advanced practices like DevOps principles such as CI/CD and TDD.
