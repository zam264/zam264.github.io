                    Hi there and welcome to you really cool website! I'm actively learning how to write HTML and CSS so you're likely to see
                    alot of updates to this site as my knowledge grows.
                    <br>
                    <br> My Name is Steven Raymond Zamborsky. I'm a Computer Science graduate from
                    <a href="https://www.sru.edu/">Slippery Rock University</a> of Pennsylvania. Since graduation I've worked at
                    <a href="https://www.creehan.com/">Creehan & Company</a>, a consulting company that was recently acquired by
                    <a href="http://www.inovalon.com/">Inovalon</a>.
                    <br>
                    <br> My job title is "Build and Release Engineer". I have a passion for creating quick, efficient and effective
                    CI/CD pipelines. I enjoy keeping up with DevOps news and technology, as well as preach the principles.
